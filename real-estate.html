        <p>Real estate transactions require knowledgeable legal counsel and personalized representation. It also helps if the lawyer advising you in the transaction is familiar with the area and the properties involved. Local attorney Pat Lausier has those traits.</p>
        <p>Having worked locally for more than 30 years, both as a certified public accountant and a lawyer, Pat Lausier understands the financial and legal underpinnings of real estate transactions, and how to represent her clients to achieve the most favorable outcomes.</p>
        <p>As a longtime local resident, she is familiar with the local real estate market and, many times, the individual properties and owners involved. Through her practice at Lausier &amp; Lausier LLC, she can protect your rights at all phases of a residential or commercial real estate transaction, from preparing and reviewing transactional documents to facilitating the closing.</p>
